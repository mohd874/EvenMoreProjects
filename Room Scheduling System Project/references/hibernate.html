      Hibernate is an Object Relational Mapping (ORM) tool. It manages
      the persistence of java objects in a relational database. The idea
      is that a programmer should be able to design his business objects
      as standard Java objects with very little interference from the
      problems of making these objects persist in a database. Together
      with a little help from the programmer, Hibernate saves the
      objects into the database, retrieves them when needed and supports
      queries on the database written in a form similar to SQL but which
      refers to objects and object properties instead of tables and
      column names. The end result is that the code that needs to be
      written to interact with the database is considerably shorter and
      simpler.
    </p><p>
      This document is intended to cover only the basics of Hibernate:
      i.e., do things the way it is described here until you have
      outgrown it. Hence many features are only referred to in passing
      or not mentioned at all. The full reference documentation and a great
      deal of other important information is available on line at <a href="http://www.hibernate.org/5.html" target="_top">http://www.hibernate.org/5.html:Hibernate
      On Line Documentation</a>. However, for serious users of
      Hibernate, a thorough study of [<a href="#BauerKing_HibernateInAction" title="[BK05]"><span class="abbrev">BK05</span></a>] is highly recommended.

        Database Interaction Pattern
      </h2></div></div></div><p>
        The basic pattern of database interactions via Hibernate is
        visible in the <code class="filename">Main.java</code> file above.
        </p><div class="orderedlist"><ol type="1"><li><p>
              Create a <code class="literal">Configuration</code> object, load the
              configuration parameters from the
              <code class="filename">hibernate.properties</code> and adjust them as required.
            </p></li><li><p>
              Create a <code class="literal">SessionFactory</code> object from the
              <code class="literal">Configuration</code> object. The
              <code class="literal">SessionFactory</code> object is a heavyweight,
              thread safe object. You would normally share one such object
              between all your threads in a web application.
            </p></li><li><p>
              For each unit of work (normally one use case) use the
              <code class="literal">SessionFactory</code> object to obtain a
              <code class="literal">Session</code> object. This is an extremely
              lightweight, non-thread safe object. It will be associated
              with a database connection but it only obtains that
              connection lazily, i.e., only when (and if) it is required.
              <code class="literal">Session</code> objects must <span class="strong"><strong>not</strong></span> be shared between different threads.
            </p></li><li><p>
              Inside a try block, get a <code class="literal">Transaction</code> object by calling
              <code class="literal">beginTransaction()</code> on the
              <code class="literal">Session</code> object.
            </p></li><li><p>
              Interact with the database:
              </p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>
                    explicitly by calling methods of <code class="literal">Session</code> to
                    associate objects to the database (i.e., map them to
                    the database), execute queries, load, save, delete mapped
                    objects etc.
                  </p></li><li><p>
                    implicitly by calling property mutators on mapped
                    objects that will lead to the database being updated.
                  </p></li><li><p>
                    implicitly by referencing non-mapped objects from
                    mapped objects which (in certain circumstances) can
                    cause the non-mapped objects to be added to the
                    database.
                  </p></li><li><p>
                    implicitly by unreferencing mapped objects from other
                    mapped objects which (in certain circumstances) can
                    cause the unreferenced objects to be deleted from the database.
                  </p></li></ul></div><p>
            </p></li><li><p>
              Call <code class="literal">commit()</code> on the
              <code class="literal">Transaction</code> object and close the try
              block, handling exceptions and closing the
              <code class="literal">Session</code> object in the usual way.
            </p></li></ol></div><p>
      </p></div><div class="sect1" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both;"><a name="object-lifecycle"></a>4.&nbsp;The Hibernate Object Life Cycle</h2></div></div></div><p>
      </p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>
            <span class="emphasis"><em>Transient</em></span> objects do not (yet) have any
            association with the database. they act like any normal Java
            object and are not saved to the database. When the last
            reference to a transient object is lost, the object itself
            is lost and is (eventually) garbage collected. There is no
            connection between transactions and such objects:
            <code class="literal">commit</code>s and
            <code class="literal">rollback</code>s have no effects on them. They
            can be turned into <span class="emphasis"><em>persistent</em></span> objects
            via one of the <code class="literal">save</code> method calls if the
            <code class="literal">Session</code> object or by adding a reference
            from a persistent object to this object.
          </p></li><li><p>
            <span class="emphasis"><em>Persistent</em></span> objects do have an
            association with the database. They are always associated
            with a persistence
            manager, i.e., a <code class="literal">Session</code> object and
            they always participate in a transaction. Actual updates of
            a database from the persistent object may occur at any time
            between when the object is updated to the end of the
            transaction: it does not necessarily happen immediately.
            However, this feature, which allows important optimizations
            in database interactions, is essentially invisible to the
            programmer. For example, one place where one might expect to
            notice the difference between the in-memory persistent
            object and the database version is at the point of executing
            a query. In such a case, Hibernate will, if necessary,
            synchronise any dirty objects with the database (i.e., save
            them) in order to ensure that the query returns the correct results.
          </p><p>
            A persistent object has a primary key value set, whether or
            not it has been actually saved to the database yet.
          </p><p>
            Calling the <code class="literal">delete</code> method of the
            <code class="literal">Session</code> object on a persistent object
            will cause its removal from the database and will make it transient.
          </p></li><li><p>
            <span class="emphasis"><em>Detached</em></span> objects are objects that were
            persistent but no longer have a connection to a
            <code class="literal">Session</code> object (usually because you
            have closed the session). Such an object contains data that
            was synchronised with the database at the time that the
            session was closed, but, since then, the database may have
            changed; with the result that this object is now
            <span class="emphasis"><em>stale</em></span>.
          </p><div class="important" style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;"><table summary="Important" border="0"><tbody><tr><td rowspan="2" align="center" valign="top" width="25"><img alt="[Important]" src="hibernate_files/important.png"></td><th align="left">Important</th></tr><tr><td colspan="2" align="left" valign="top"><p>
              A <span class="emphasis"><em>detached</em></span> object may be re-attached
              later to another <code class="literal">Session</code> object to
              become persistent again. Thus, in essence, these objects
              can happily exist, and be used, without concern for being
              inside a transaction. This mechanism, in fact, is the
              basis for letting business objects which are stored
              persistently in the database, to escape up to higher
              levels in the system without having to add extra value
              beans (also known as <span class="emphasis"><em>Data Transfer Objects
              (DTOs)</em></span> which exist to copy the data of objects
              tied to one layer in the system to objects tied to another
              layer. Without this mechanism, one typically has to create
              a number of classes for each business object, where the
              instance variables are all basically the same, but which
              differ in the layer specific details.

      Given a pair of (persistent) objects of the same class, we now
      have three concepts of identity to consider.
      </p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><pre class="programlisting">a==b  <em class="lineannotation"><span class="lineannotation">Java Identity</span></em></pre></li><li><pre class="programlisting">a.equals(b)  <em class="lineannotation"><span class="lineannotation">Java Equality</span></em></pre></li><li><pre class="programlisting">a.getId().equals(b.getId())  <em class="lineannotation"><span class="lineannotation">Database Identity</span></em></pre></li></ul></div><p>
      The rule for Hibernate, is that if, within a single session, you
      request two objects which have the same database identifier, then
      you will get references to the same actual objects. However, if
      you reattach a object to a session, you have a potential source of
      confusion in that you could end up with two different persistent
      objects (different as defined by Java Equality), which should be stored
      in the same database row.
    </p><p>
      Since the programmer can define the meaning of <span class="emphasis"><em>Java
      Equality</em></span>, it is important <span class="strong"><strong>not</strong></span> to use the <code class="literal">id</code>
      field in that definition if the <code class="literal">id</code> field is a
      surrogate key. This is because Hibernate only sets the field when
      saving the object. Hence, for example, if you add the object to
      some set collection, then saving the object will result in its
      identity changing, and part of the rules about using the set
      collection class is that the contained object's identity must not
      change while it is in the collection.
    </p><p>
      In fact, this situation is almost certain to occur because of the
      frequent use of collection classes to represent the
      <span class="emphasis"><em>many</em></span> side of <code class="literal">one-to-many</code>
      or <code class="literal">many-to-many</code> relationships. Therefore we use
      the Java Equality concept to define when two objects should really
      be the same database object.
    </p><p>
      However, there are other problems with using all the non-id values
      of an object in the equality test: you really want the test to
      return true if the objects map to the same row of the the same
      table in the database (i.e. they represent the same real world
      concept). But two objects may represent the same real world object
      and have some different values. For example, two
      <code class="literal">Customer</code> objects may differ in the value of a
      password property (because the two objects date from different
      instances in time between which the customer has change her
      password). But they still refer to the same real world concept:
      i.e., the same customer.
    </p><p>
      The solution is to decide on a <span class="emphasis"><em>Business Key</em></span>
      for a class. This is like a database key, but involves no
      generated surrogate keys. Instead it consists of those
      "real-world" properties of the class that the programmer considers
      to uniquely identify a particular record. It is not a requirement
      that the business key absolutely never changes, merely that it
      changes will not change within the period in which it might be
      stored in memory in a collection class. For the <code class="literal">Customer</code>
      class on a web application, an appropriate business key might be
      the customer's email address. This, of course, can change, in
      which case the customer will be treated as a new different
      customer. However, this is rarely a significant problem, and if it
      is, one can always provide a mechanism to reconnect the old data
      about the customer to the new customer record. More importantly,
      from our point of view, a change of customer email address is
      extremely unlikely to affect any reattachment of a detached
      Customer object to a new session.
    </p><p>
      Note that Hibernate does not know or care anything about your business
      keys. As far as it is concerned, reattaching an object works by
      checking the <code class="literal">id</code> property of the object. If it
      is <code class="literal">null</code>, then the object is a new one that
      could be added to the database but certainly cannot be reattached.
      Otherwise, the object can be matched up with a record in the
      database and, on reattachment, the contents of the object are used
      to update the contents of the corresponding database record(s).
    </p><p>
      In writing an equals method, there are two important
      considerations to bear in mind:
      </p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>
            If you write an <code class="literal">equals</code> method, you must
            write a <code class="literal">hashCode</code> method which always
            returns the same value for two objects which
            <code class="literal">equals</code> decides are equal.
          </p></li><li><p>
            When referring to instance variables of the argument object,
            always use the accessor method rather than the raw instance
            variable: this is because, in an environment such as a web
            application or service, you may actually be dealing with
            a proxy object rather than the actual object you expect for
            reasons of, for example, distributed load balancing or
            scalability to very large service loads.
          </p></li></ul></div><p>
      Given that, the <code class="literal">equals</code> and
      <code class="literal">hashCode</code> methods should be
      written as follows:
      </p><pre class="programlisting">public class Customer
{
    â¦
    public boolean equals(Object other)
    {
        if (this==other)
            return true;
        if (other==null)
            return false;
        if (!(other instanceof Customer))
            return false;
        final Customer o = (Customer) other;
        return this.emailAddress.equals(o.getEmailAddress());
    }

    public int hashCode()
    {
        return emailAddress.hashCode();
    }
}</pre><p>

      </h2></div></div></div><p>
        A Hibernate object, suitable for mapping into a database, is a
        normal java bean with a number of extra requirements.
      </p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>
            There must be a default constructor for the class.
          </p></li><li><p>
            There must be accessors and mutators for all the instance
            variables of the class. Actually this is overstating the
            requirement but is a good base rule: read the Hibernate
            documentation for the full details.
          </p></li><li><p>
            The class should implement
            <code class="literal">Serializable</code>. Strictly speaking, this
            is not a requirement. However, in practice you will normally
            want your Hibernate objects to be serializable so that they
            can be (potentially) migrated around a multiprocessor
            cluster or saved and restored across a web server reboot etc.
          </p></li><li><p>
            The class should have an <code class="literal">id</code> instance
            variable, usually of type <code class="literal">Long</code>. Again
            this is not a true requirement but it is recommended to use
            automatically generated surrogate keys and, if so, to use an
            instance variable called <code class="literal">id</code> to hold it.
            Certainly, alternatives are possible.
          </p></li><li><p>
            The mutator for the <code class="literal">id</code> property should
            be private, not public. Again not a requirement but good
            practice. You should never update the
            <code class="literal">id</code> property directly but rather rely on
            Hibernate updating it for you. In practice, it is the value
            of this field that Hibernate uses to decide if an object has
            been mapped to a database record or not. Change the property
            yourself and you could seriously confuse Hibernate.
          </p></li><li><p>
            You should decide on a business key for the object and
            implement the <code class="literal">equals</code> and
            <code class="literal">hashCode</code> methods for it.
          </p></li><li><p>
            You should add any extra type specific constructors (which
            should leave the <code class="literal">id</code> field
            <code class="literal">null</code>) and business rule methods you like.
          </p></li><li><p>
            You should not make the class <code class="literal">final</code> if
            you want to be able to use <span class="emphasis"><em>lazy loading</em></span>
            for objects of the class.
          </p></li></ul></div></div><div class="sect1" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both;"><a name="session"></a>6.&nbsp;The Session</h2></div></div></div><p>
      Once you have a <code class="literal">Session</code> object, and are
      executing inside a <code class="literal">Transaction</code>, there are a
      number of ways you can interact with the database.
      </p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>
            <code class="literal">session.get</code> is used to create a new
            persistent object by <code class="literal">id</code> from the database. It
            returns <code class="literal">null</code> if there was no such
            object in the database. <code class="literal">session.load</code> is
            similar except that if there was no such object in the
            database it throws an exception.
            </p><div class="important" style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;"><table summary="Important" border="0"><tbody><tr><td rowspan="2" align="center" valign="top" width="25"><img alt="[Important]" src="hibernate_files/important.png"></td><th align="left">Important</th></tr><tr><td colspan="2" align="left" valign="top"><p><a name="lazy-loading"></a>
                Conceptually, these methods do not
                <span class="emphasis"><em>just</em></span> get the object requested but
                also all objects that it refers to through its
                properties, and, transitively, all objects that they
                refer to as well, and so on. If the database is large,
                and there is a path of associations from every object to
                every other object, then fetching one object could try
                to load in the entire database. There are two issues to
                consider:
                </p><div class="orderedlist"><ol type="1"><li><p>
                      Controlling what really gets loaded while still
                      making everything work as if everything referred
                      to has been loaded. This is done by a technique of
                      <span class="emphasis"><em>lazy</em></span> loading using
                      <span class="emphasis"><em>proxies</em></span>. To specify the use
                      of proxies for a class, the attribute
                      <code class="literal">lazy="true"</code> must be specified
                      for that class in the mapping file. 
                    </p><p>
                      Using lazy fetching, however, now means that such
                      lazy associations can only be turned into eager
                      associations (by a process called
                      <span class="emphasis"><em>initialisation</em></span>) <span class="strong"><strong>within</strong></span> a session. Within
                      a session, simply accessing a
                      non-<code class="literal">id</code> property of a
                      persistent (although possibly lazy)
                      object initialises it. But once the object is
                      detached, any request for a lazy and
                      uninitialised property will throw an exception.
                      There is a static method,
                      <code class="literal">Hibernate.initialise</code>, which can
                      be used to ensure that a lazy or proxy object is
                      materialised before closing the
                      <code class="literal">session</code>, and another
                      <code class="literal">Hibernate.isInitialised</code>, to
                      test its initialisation state. However, these methods do not
                      work recursively over the whole object graph.
                      Therefore, the programmer must do one of the
                      following:
                      </p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="circle"><li><p>
                            Recursively walk over the object graph,
                            initialising objects on the way.
                          </p></li><li><p>
                            Re-attach the object to a session before
                            de-referencing potentially uninitialised
                            objects.
                          </p></li><li><p>
                            Load the objects in a query in which the
                            fetch strategy has been changed to an eager
                            one. This runtime mechanism can override the
                            <span class="emphasis"><em>lazy</em></span> setting for the
                            objects in the mapping file.
                          </p></li><li><p>
                            Keep the session open until any possible
                            chain of dereferences of the properties of
                            the object has been completed.
                          </p></li></ul></div><p>
                      
                    </p><p>
                      The standard advice ([<a href="#BauerKing_HibernateInAction" title="[BK05]"><span class="abbrev">BK05</span></a>]) is to make
                      all associations lazy by default in the mapping
                      files and override this at runtime, where
                      necessary, with queries that force eager fetching.
                    </p></li><li><p>
                      Loading parts of the object graph efficiently. The
                      naÃ¯ve approach would be for Hibernate to
                      simply load the object requested, get the
                      <code class="literal">id</code>s of the objects referred to,
                      load them and so on, with each load being a
                      separate SQL query. Hibernate provides that
                      strategy as an option, but a possibly significantly
                      more efficient strategy is also available: that of
                      executing an outer join to get the first object
                      and the objects it refers to in one query. This is
                      specified in the mapping file with the attribute
                      <code class="literal">outer-join="true"</code> on the
                      association elements, i.e.,
                      <code class="literal">one-to-one</code>
                      <code class="literal">many-to-one</code>,
                      <code class="literal">one-to-many</code> and
                      <code class="literal">many-to-many</code>. For detailed
                      semantics and other parameters of this feature,
                      see the manual <a href="http://www.hibernate.org/5.html" target="_top">http://www.hibernate.org/5.html:Hibernate
                      On Line Documentation</a>.

          </p></li><li><p>
            <code class="literal">session.delete</code> will cause the database
            row corresponding to a persistent (or even a detached!)
            object to be deleted and the object will become transient.
            What happens to persistent objects it refers to depends on
            the cascade properties of the mapping configuration for that
            reference.
          </p></li><li><p>
            <code class="literal">session.save</code> on a transient item will
            assign it a <code class="literal">id</code> and make the object
            persistent: i.e., ensure it, and any
            other objects it refers to, get saved to the database. This
            operation essentially calls an <code class="literal">SQL
            INSERT</code> to be executed. Any further calls to the
            mutators of the object within the transaction will cause an
            <code class="literal">SQL UPDATE</code> to be invoked.
          </p></li><li><p>
            <code class="literal">session.lock</code> and
            <code class="literal">session.update</code> are both intended for
            reattaching a detached object. Normally you should use
            <code class="literal">session.update</code> which triggers an
            <code class="literal">SQL UPDATE</code> to the database row with
            <code class="literal">id</code> equal to that of the object. Thus
            if the database and the object disagreed on the values
            contained, then the object overrides the database.
            <code class="literal">session.lock</code> simply reattaches the
            object (to the session) without checking or updating the
            database on the assumption that the database is still fully
            in synch with the object. Generally, do not use this method
            unless you are absolutely sure that nothing has changed the
            database state of the object since it was detached or if it
            does not matter because you will be overwriting all columns
            that could have changed anyway later on in the transaction.
          </p></li><li><p>
            <code class="literal">session.saveOrUpdate</code> is a convenience
            method that checks whether the object is transient, in which case
            it acts like <code class="literal">session.save</code>, or detached,
            in which case it acts like <code class="literal">session.update</code>.

      Querying
    </h2></div></div></div><p>
      So far, our discussions above show how to fetch an object from the
      database if we know its <code class="literal">id</code>. Obviously we need
      more powerful querying facilities.
    </p><p>
      As describe above, one of the simplest ways of querying is simply
      by invoking a chain of accessor methods on a persistent object:
      </p><pre class="programlisting">X x = z.getY().getX()</pre><p>
    </p><p>
      The most critical type of access that is not covered above is
      finding an object (or collection of objects) when you have some
      information about them but not the identifier and you do not have
      a persistent object available that refers to them. For example, if
      we want to find the customers whose email address match a given
      one. Here we can use the <code class="literal">session.find</code> method.
      This method always returns a (possibly empty) list of the
      appropriate result objects. There are three forms of find:
      </p><div class="orderedlist"><ol type="1"><li><p>
            <code class="literal">session.find(queryString)</code> where
            queryString is a <code class="literal">String</code> containing no
            "?" parameter placeholders. In this case the query takes no
            parameters and can be executed directly.
          </p></li><li><p>
            <code class="literal">session.find(queryString, pObject, pType)</code> where
            queryString is a <code class="literal">String</code> containing one
            "?" parameter placeholder, <code class="literal">pObject</code> is an object of the
            required type to use as the indicated parameter and <code class="literal">pType</code> is
            the corresponding Hibernate type constant (e.g.
            <code class="literal">Hibernate.STRING</code>, 
            <code class="literal">Hibernate.DATE</code>, etc.). In this case the
            object is substituted into the query in much the same way
            that JDBC preparedStatement queries have their parameters
            substituted in.
          </p></li><li><p>
            <code class="literal">session.find(queryString, pObjectArray,
            pTypeArray)</code> where queryString is a
            <code class="literal">String</code> containing one or more "?"
            parameter placeholders, <code class="literal">pObjectArray</code> is
            an array of objects of the required size and types to use as
            the indicated parameters and <code class="literal">pTypeArray</code>
            is the corresponding array of Hibernate type constants,
            which again must match. In this case the objects from the
            object array are substituted into the query in much the same
            way that JDBC preparedStatement queries have their
            parameters substituted in.
          </p></li></ol></div><p>
    </p><p>
      Finally, the query string format is not <span class="emphasis"><em>SQL</em></span>
      but <span class="emphasis"><em>HQL</em></span>. <span class="emphasis"><em>HQL</em></span> is
      Hibernate's query language which looks very similar to SQL but
      where, instead of names of tables and columns, the query uses
      names of java objects and properties. Of course there is a great
      deal more to it that that and full details can be found in <a href="http://www.hibernate.org/5.html" target="_top">http://www.hibernate.org/5.html:Hibernate

      Cascading Persistence
    </h2></div></div></div><p>
      We have said, a number of times, that when an object is made
      persistent, that the objects it refers to are also made
      persistent. This was an oversimplification. In the mapping files
      for the classes, there is an attribute,
      <code class="literal">cascade</code> that lets us control how much, or how
      little, of a reference graph gets automatically persisted, deleted
      or updated. The values that it can be set to, and their meanings,
      are as follows:
      </p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>
            <code class="literal">none</code>: no automatic action on the
            referenced object takes place.
          </p></li><li><p>
            <code class="literal">save-update</code>: automatically save or
            update the referenced object when the referencing object is
            saved or the transaction commits.
          </p><p>
            <code class="literal">delete</code>: automatically delete the
            referenced object when <code class="literal">delete()</code> is
            called on the referencing object. Note that, if the
            referencing object is not deleted but merely removes its
            reference to the referenced object, then this option will
            not do anything and, potentially, a garbage (or orphan)
            object will be left in the database.
          </p></li><li><p>
            <code class="literal">delete-orphan</code>: automatically delete any
            object for whom the reference has been removed from the
            referencing object.
          </p></li><li><p>
            <code class="literal">all</code>: take the same actions as
            <code class="literal">save-update</code> and
            <code class="literal">delete</code> but not that of
            <code class="literal">delete-orphan</code>.
          </p></li><li><p>
            <code class="literal">all-delete-orphan</code>: take the same action
            as <code class="literal">save-update</code>,
            <code class="literal">delete</code> and
            <code class="literal">delete-orphan</code>.

          </p></li></ul></div><p>

      As we have seen, the standard pattern for executing a use case is
      to get a <code class="literal">Session</code> from the
      <code class="literal">SessionFactory</code>, get a
      <code class="literal">Transaction</code> from the
      <code class="literal">Session</code>, interact with the database via the
      <code class="literal">Session</code>, <code class="literal">commit</code> the
      <code class="literal">Transaction</code> and close the
      <code class="literal">Session</code>. Details of the exception handling have
      been given above. This is fine for normal, fully serialised
      database transactions but there are two situations when it is not
      fine:

            When using an isolation level other than full
            <span class="emphasis"><em>serializable</em></span>. There are 4 standard
            transaction isolation levels: <span class="emphasis"><em>Read
            Uncommitted</em></span>, <span class="emphasis"><em>Read Committed</em></span>,
            <span class="emphasis"><em>Repeatable Read</em></span> and
            <span class="emphasis"><em>Serializable</em></span>. They indicate different
            levels of locking strategies used within transactions and
            effect just how isolated one transaction really is from
            other transactions running simultaneously. Thus
            <span class="emphasis"><em>Serializable</em></span> means that two
            transactions run as if one had completely finished
            (committed or rolled back) before the other had started. In
            practice, providing this level of isolation requires
            considerable resources and causes problems with scalability
            of applications. For this reason, most applications use a
            weaker form of isolation and use other strategies to
            overcome the consequent problems that can arise.
          </p><p>
            The most common isolation level used, and the default
            obtained with a PostgreSQL JDBC connection, is
            <span class="emphasis"><em>Read Committed</em></span>. This ensures that one
            transaction can not see any value which has been written by
            another transaction if that other transaction has not yet
            committed. Therefore we don't have to worry about the other
            transaction rolling back with the result that we would have
            to roll back this transaction. With this level, the
            isolation problems that can occur are:
            </p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>
                  Lost Updates: tx 1 reads a row, tx 2 reads the
                  same row, tx1 writes the row and commits, tx 2 writes
                  the row and commits, the value written by tx1 is lost.
                  This can be dealt with using
                  <span class="emphasis"><em>versioning</em></span> (see below).
                </p></li><li><p>
                  Unrepeatable Reads: Transaction (tx) 1 reads a row, tx
                  2 writes the row and commits, tx 1 reads the same row
                  and gets a different result from last time. The fact
                  that Hibernate uses a cache, and, adding to that, the
                  use of <span class="emphasis"><em>versioning</em></span>, will handle
                  this situation.
                </p></li><li><p>
                  Phantom Read: tx 1 executes a
                  <code class="literal">Select</code> query. tx 2 inserts or
                  deletes new rows in the database and commits, tx 1
                  executes the same query again and finds a different
                  set of rows from what was there last time. There is
                  very little that you can do about this except to be
                  aware, when you design your transactions, of the issue.
                </p></li></ul></div><p>
          </p></li><li><p>
            When long transactions are required. Here the problem is
            usually that some user interaction, which could take a
            considerable period of time, is required in a use case with
            database accesses taking place both before and after the user
            interaction. The issue is that we should not keep a database
            transaction open for a long period of time (i.e., for more
            than a fraction of a second), whereas a user interaction
            could take from minutes to hours. The solution is to break
            the long transaction up into two (or more) database
            transactions, and to use detached objects from the first
            transaction to carry the necessary information to the
            presentation layer. These objects get modified, outside any
            transaction, as part of the user interaction and then
            reattached to the second transaction to cause the necessary
            updates.
          </p><p>
            If we left it at that, then all the isolation problems
            described above could occur, as well as the nastier one of a
            <span class="emphasis"><em>Dirty Read</em></span>: Consider a long transaction
            and a normal transaction: the first contains two database
            transactions <code class="literal">tx1a</code> and
            <code class="literal">tx1b</code> (perhaps the first is to book a
            flight, the second to book a hotel). The other transaction,
            <code class="literal">tx2</code> might be to order meals for the
            passengers on the flight (okay; not very realistic but you
            get the idea). Now <code class="literal">tx1a</code> could update a
            row and commit and <code class="literal">tx2</code> could read it. Now
            <code class="literal">tx1b</code> decides to roll back (perhaps there
            were no hotels available). This only rolls back
            <code class="literal">tx1b</code> itself, because
            <code class="literal">tx1a</code> is committed and cannot be rolled
            back, but since this is part of a long transaction, the
            programmer has written explicit code to undo the effects of
            <code class="literal">tx1a</code> when <code class="literal">tx1b</code> rolls
            back (such an undo operation is normally called a
            <span class="emphasis"><em>compensating</em></span> transaction: it may not
            even really undo the original transaction, it might only make
            up for it in some way such as authorizing a reimbursement or
            a voucher if a promised booking cannot be honoured). Now
            <code class="literal">tx2</code> has executed, read data from a long
            transaction, which has since been undone, and has committed.
            To be correct, the effects of this second transaction should
            be undone as well but there is no way of knowing this.
          </p><p>
            The safe solution here is only to allow database
            writes in the last database transaction of a long
            transaction, and to use <span class="emphasis"><em>versioning</em></span>
            there. Under certain application specific circumstances,
            more relaxed strategies can be taken but the above rule of
            thumb is safe and simple and should only be ignored with
            very careful analysis.

        The idea of versioning is very simple and particularly easy to
        handle with the support Hibernate provides:
        </p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>
              Add a version instance variable, and corresponding
              accessor and mutator methods, to your objects. An
              <code class="literal">int</code> or <code class="literal">long</code> is
              recommended although some people prefer a
              <code class="literal">TimeStamp</code> or
              <code class="literal">Calendar</code>. The latter two have slightly
              worse performance and are not absolutely guaranteed to
              work correctly (one might end up with two updates made so
              close together in time that they have the same
              <code class="literal">TimeStamp</code> value - although some
              operating systems ensure that this can not the case), but
              they have the advantage that you can easily see exactly
              when the update was made.
            </p></li><li><p>
              declare the version instance variable in your mapping file
              for the class. This requires the following element added to
              the mapping file immediately after your
              <code class="literal">id</code> element (assuming your instance
              variable is called "version" and you want it in a column
              in the database called "version"):

      </p><p>
        Now whenever you make an object dirty in memory, Hibernate will
        update its version (in memory). Whenever the object gets flushed
        to disk (e.g., at the end of a transaction or because you call
        <code class="literal">session.update</code> or
        <code class="literal">session.saveOrUpdate</code> to re-attach a detached
        object, Hibernate will throw a
        <code class="literal">StaleObjectStateException</code> if the version
        number of the object on disk is not the same as it was when the
        object was loaded. By catching that exception, the programmer
        can then decide what to do about the conflict (e.g., report back
        to the user that the choice he/she has just made is, in fact, no longer
        available and could they please make another one).

      Hibernate objects, i.e., objects whose persistence Hibernate will

            <span class="emphasis"><em>Entity</em></span> beans are objects which have a persistent identity:
            i.e., usually and identifier field which is managed by
            Hibernate. These are typically the central business objects
            in an application such as User, Customer, Order etc.
          </p><p>
            <span class="emphasis"><em>Value</em></span> beans are objects which only exist in relationship to
            an <span class="emphasis"><em>entity</em></span> bean. These are typically
            support objects for the entity objects such as Address.
          </p></li></ol></div><p>
    </p><p>
      The connection between <span class="emphasis"><em>entity</em></span> beans and database
      tables and columns is described in a mapping file: usually
      named <code class="literal">X.hbm.xml</code> for class <code class="literal">X</code>
      and stored in the same directory as the compiled file <code class="filename">X.class</code>.
    </p><p>
      The connection between <span class="emphasis"><em>value</em></span> beans and the
      database is usually described in the mapping file for the corresponding
      <span class="emphasis"><em>entity</em></span> bean.
    </p><p>
      In the following sections, we will look at the details of how to
      specify mappings for different types of mappings and classes. We

              (it defaults to a suitable SQL name based on the class

	Mapping Value Objects within Entities
      </h3></div></div></div><p>
	Sometimes on has properties of entity beans which are more
	complex than simple base types but which are totally owned by
	the entity. The standard example is that of an
	<code class="literal">Address</code> object stored as a property of a
	<code class="literal">Person</code> object. In this case there is only one
	<code class="literal">Address</code> object for the Person object.
	</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="hibernate_files/component.png" alt="Value Component"><div class="caption"><p>
	      A Value Component
	    </p></div></div><p>
      </p><p>
	While there are a number of ways this can be handled, but the
	simplest, which Hibernate calls <span class="emphasis"><em>components</em></span>
	is to store both the parent object (<code class="literal">Person</code>)
	and the child (<code class="literal">Address</code>) in the same database
	row, to construct and connect the two objects on reading this
	row from the database and to coalesce the two objects and write
	them together when saving or updating either of them. To specify
	this, you use a <code class="literal">component</code> sub-element for the
	child object in the class element for the parent object instead
	of the usual <code class="literal">property</code> element. Thus, instead
	of something like
	</p><pre class="programlisting">&lt;property name="address" type="string"/&gt;</pre><p>
        one would enter:
	</p><pre class="programlisting">&lt;component name="address" class="Address"&gt;
    &lt;property name="street"   column="user_street"/&gt;
    &lt;property name="postcode" column="user_postcode"/&gt;
&lt;/component&gt;</pre><p>
      </p><p>
	Some details to be aware of are:
	</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol type="1"><li><p>
	      These child objects are wholly owned by their
	      parents: you cannot have two different parents.
	    </p></li><li><p>
	      A null child property is represented in the database by
	      setting to <code class="literal">null</code> all the fields
	      corresponding to the child object. Thus loading such a row
	      will result in a parent object with a null child property,
	      not a parent object with a child object whose properties
	      are all null.
	    </p></li><li><p>
	      Not only can you have multiple components in a class, but
	      one can have multiple components of the same (child) class
	      in a class: simply make sure that the component names are
	      different and that the database field names (the
	      <code class="literal">column</code> attributes are different for the
	      different components
	    </p><p>
	      Normally, the child object has no way to reference its
	      parent object. However, if you want a property of the
	      child object to refer to its parent, add a element of the
	      form
	      </p><pre class="programlisting">&lt;parent name="person"/&gt;</pre><p>
	      to make a <code class="literal">person</code> property of the child
	      object refer to its parent object.
	    </p></li></ol></div><p>
      </p></div><div class="sect2" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="inheritance-mapping"></a>10.3.&nbsp;
	Mapping Entities with Inheritance
      </h3></div></div></div><p>
	Again there are a number of ways Hibernate can handle
	inheritance. These are based on the standard techniques for
	reducing generalisation hierarchies in entity-relationship
	diagrams[<a href="#BatiniCeriNavathe_ConceptualDatabaseDesign" title="[BCN91]"><span class="abbrev">BCN91</span></a>].
      </p><p>
	The simplest is to use one table for the whole hierarchy. With
	this design, each row of the table can hold an object of any
	type from the hierarchy. There is one column for each of the
	properties in the union of the sets of properties of all the
	classes in the hierarchy and there is one
	<code class="literal">discriminator</code> column which contains a value
	(usually of type string, character or integer)
	used to tell which actual type of object is stored in this
	particular row. One normally does not make this discriminator a
	property of the class: it is used only by Hibernate to record
	and detect the type of the object that a row represents.

	Many-to-One, Unidirectional Associations
      </h3></div></div></div><p>
        This corresponds to the standard Java reference to one object
	from another.

	      A Many-to-One, Unidirectional Association
	    </p></div></div><p>
      </p><p>
        In the diagram above, we represent the relationship between
	students and their thesis supervisors. In this design, a student
	can have no more than one supervisor but may not (yet) have any.
	However, a lecturer may have any number, including zero, of
	students to supervise. Furthermore, we only allow a one
	directional link: Student has a property (say
	<code class="literal">getSupervisor/setSupervisor</code>) but there is no
	direct way, starting with a <code class="literal">Lecturer</code> object,
	to find the students that the lecturer supervises.
      </p><p>
	If we start with the simple, non-related, base entity mapping
	files for <code class="literal">Student</code> and
	<code class="literal">Lecturer</code>, we add this association by adding
	the following, as a sub-element of the class element, to the mapping file for
	<code class="literal">Student</code>:
	</p><pre class="programlisting">&lt;many-to-one name="supervisor"	column="supervisor"/&gt;</pre><p>
	This element acts very much like a normal property element in
	that it defines the mapping between the
	<code class="literal">supervisor</code> property of
	<code class="literal">Student</code> and the column in the
	<code class="literal">students</code> table. However, it also sets up the
	relationship so that, after getting a <code class="literal">Student</code>
	object from the database, if we use the
	<code class="literal">supervisor</code> accessor of that
	<code class="literal">Student</code> object, we will get the corresponding
	<code class="literal">Lecturer</code> object (or a proxy thereof if we
	have enabled lazy loading of the <code class="literal">Lecturer</code>
	objects). Finally, it ensures that the underlying database is
	created with a foreign key constraint that the
	<code class="literal">supervisor</code> column is a foreign key into the
	<code class="literal">lecturers</code> table.
      </p><p>
	As things stand, there is now a question of what you want the
	<code class="literal">cascade</code> behaviour of the relationship to be
	(see the section on <a href="#cascade" title="8.&nbsp;
      Cascading Persistence
    ">cascade</a>
	above). Without adding the optional <code class="literal">cascade</code>
	attribute to the <code class="literal">many-to-one</code> element, then
	the <code class="literal">Lecturer</code> object on the other end of the
	association is ignored when the <code class="literal">Student</code>
	object is saved, updated, deleted or when its
	<code class="literal">supervisor</code> property is reset away from it.
	Certainly we would not want the lecturer to be removed from the
	database when the student is deleted or when the student no
	longer has that lecturer as his or her supervisor; so none of
	the <code class="literal">delete</code> or <code class="literal">all</code> options
	are appropriate. But what about <code class="literal">save-update</code>?.
	There are two scenarios under which this might have an effect:
	</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol type="1"><li><p>
	      If you create a new (transient) lecturer and make a
	      persistent student refer to it. In fact, for this
	      particular object design, one would never do such a thing:
	      the obvious semantics of the situation dictate that you
	      cannot just invent new lecturers on demand: you would
	      always have to have the lecturer as a currently existing
	      object in the database before setting the student's
	      supervisor property to that lecturer. Since the scenario
	      will never arise, this is neither a vote for or against
	      using the <code class="literal">save-update</code> option.
	    </p></li><li><p>
	      If the <code class="literal">Student</code>, and associated
	      <code class="literal">Lecturer</code> objects were detached, and now
	      you reattach the <code class="literal">Student</code> object, then
	      you need the <code class="literal">save-update</code> option if you
	      want the <code class="literal">Lecturer</code> object to be
	      reattached automatically. Without that, you need to
	      reattach it directly yourself â an easy task to
	      overlook and therefore a source of bugs. This therefore,
	      is a vote for set the
	      <code class="literal">cascade="save-update"</code> option.
	    </p></li></ol></div><p>
      </p><p>
	Note that you can specify <code class="literal">unique="true"</code> as an
	attribute of the <code class="literal">many-to-one</code> element. This
	has the effect of disallowing the possibility of having two
	student rows with the same <code class="literal">supervisor</code> values,
	i.e., turning the "*" on the <code class="literal">Student</code> side of
	the class diagram into a "0..1" or limiting each lecturer to
	having at most one supervisee. Similarly, specifying
	<code class="literal">not-null="true"</code> adds the requirement that
	every student must have a valid supervisor, i.e., it changes the
	"0..1" on the <code class="literal">Lecturer</code> side of the diagram to a "1".

	One-to-Many, Unidirectional Associations
      </h3></div></div></div><p>
	This relationship is essentially the same as last one, but now
	we choose the opposite direction for navigating the connection.
	Thus our <code class="literal">Lecturer</code> object now has a property
	which is a collection of <code class="literal">Student</code> objects while the
	<code class="literal">Student</code> objects have no properties which
	refer to their supervising <code class="literal">Lecturer</code>.
	</p><div class="warning" style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;"><table summary="Warning" border="0"><tbody><tr><td rowspan="2" align="center" valign="top" width="25"><img alt="[Warning]" src="hibernate_files/warning.png"></td><th align="left">Warning</th></tr><tr><td colspan="2" align="left" valign="top"><p>
	    For reasons described below, we would (almost) never use
	    such an association: it is inefficient and there is almost
	    no overhead in converting it to a much more efficient
	    bidirectional association. Nonetheless, it is useful to
	    discuss this case as a first step towards the bidirectional
	    version of the association.
	  </p></td></tr></tbody></table></div><p>
	</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="hibernate_files/unidir_one_to_many.png" alt="A One-to-Many, Unidirectional Association"><div class="caption"><p>
	      A One-to-Many, Unidirectional Association
	    </p></div></div><p>
      </p><p>
	As far as the database is concerned, there is no difference
	between this and the unidirectional
	<code class="literal">many-to-one</code> association: there will still be
	a single column in the table holding the
	<code class="literal">Student</code> objects that contains a foreign key
	into the table holding the <code class="literal">Lecturer</code> objects.
      </p><p>
	Now that entities are being stored in collections, it becomes
	critical that you have appropriately implemented
	<code class="literal">equals</code> and <code class="literal">hashCode</code>
	methods for those entities. In particular, you should ensure that
	these methods are independent of the generated surrogate keys
	and that trivial changes to the object do not effect the
	methods while the objects are in the collections.
      </p><p>
	The simplest collection, for our purposes, is a
	<code class="literal">Set</code>. To create the association, we add a
	<code class="literal">Set</code> valued property to
	<code class="literal">Lecturer</code>
	</p><pre class="programlisting">&lt;set name="advisees" cascade="save-update" lazy="true"&gt;
    &lt;key column="lecturer_id"/&gt;
    &lt;one-to-many class="Student"/&gt;
&lt;/set&gt;</pre><p>
	Here, we define a property of <code class="literal">Lecturer</code> which
	is <code class="literal">Set</code> valued. The name of the property is
	<code class="literal">advisees</code>. This property is to capture a
	<code class="literal">one-to-many</code> association to the
	<code class="literal">Student</code> class and it this association is to be implemented in the
	database as a foreign key to the table holding
	<code class="literal">Lecturer</code> objects stored in the column
	<code class="literal">lecturer_id</code> in the table holding
	<code class="literal">Student</code> objects.
      </p><p>
	There are a number of constraints imposed by the use of this
	<code class="literal">one-to-many</code> association which arises from the
	fact that it is represented by this "reverse" link from the
	contained object side of the association:
	</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol type="1"><li><p>
	      From a Java point of view, we could potentially have two
	      different <code class="literal">Lecturer</code> objects, both of
	      which have the same <code class="literal">Student</code> object in
	      their container. However, this is not possible for a
	      <code class="literal">one-to-many</code> association because, in the
	      database, each <code class="literal">Student</code> row refers to
	      the single <code class="literal">Lecturer</code> row which contains
	      it. If you want the true Java semantics, you have to
	      represent the association as a
	      <code class="literal">many-to-many</code> one.
	    </p></li><li><p>
	      You cannot have the same object multiple times in the same
	      collection. This is obvious when the collection property
	      is of type <code class="literal">Set</code>, but one could use other
	      types, such as List. However, the implementation of
	      association by the reverse foreign key makes this
	      impossible. Again, a <code class="literal">many-to-many</code>
	      association can provide the appropriate semantics
	    </p></li></ol></div><p>
      </p><p>
	Finally, there is the question of why
	<code class="literal">one-to-many</code> associations between entities cause
	problems. Consider the following code:
	</p><pre class="programlisting">tx = session.beginTransaction();
Lecturer lect = new Lecturer("Gordon Brown") ;
lect.getAdvisees().add(new Student("Tony Blair")) ;
lect.getAdvisees().add(new Student("Michael Howard")) ;
session.save(lect);
tx.commit();</pre><p>
        Note that the association <span class="emphasis"><em>belongs</em></span> to the
	<code class="literal">Lecturer</code> class (as it is defined in
	<code class="literal">Lecturer</code>'s mapping file). This means that
	adding a student to a lecturer's advisees is considered an
	operation on a lecturer, not on a student. Thus the
	<span class="emphasis"><em>SQL</em></span> statements that would be generated for
	the above statements would include an insert for the lecturer
	object, together with an insert each for the two connected
	student objects (because the students are referred to by the
	lecturer and we have put the <code class="literal">cascade="save-update"</code>
	declaration in the <code class="literal">Lecturer</code>'s mapping file.
	But because the association does not belong to the students, the
	saving of the students would not set the foreign key value to the
	advising lecture. Thus there would be two extra update statements for adding
	the lecturer's foreign key value into the student records. These
	extra two update statements are not just an efficiency problem:
	If every student should have a supervisor, then we would like to
	add the <code class="literal">not-null="true"</code> attribute to the
	<code class="literal">key</code> element in the mapping file for the
	association. However this would cause errors as the above
	sequence of inserts and updates does insert nulls (if only to
	immediately update them) where they should never occur.
      </p><p>
	The solution is to only create such
	<code class="literal">one-to-many</code> associations as the inverse end
	of a bidirectional <code class="literal">many-to-one</code> association.
	This gives ownership of the association to the
	<code class="literal">Student</code> end and, as we see below, leads to
	the foreign key being created as part of the initial insert of
	the <code class="literal">Student</code> record instead of after it as a
	consequence of the <code class="literal">Lecturer</code> insert.
      </p></div><div class="sect2" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="many-to-one-bidir"></a>10.6.&nbsp;
	Many-to-one, bidirectional Associations
      </h3></div></div></div><p>
	In this case we allow navigation in both directions between the
	two classes. On the <span class="emphasis"><em>Many</em></span> side it is a
	standard java reference. on the <span class="emphasis"><em>One</em></span> side it
	is a collection. However, the two associations are not
	independent of each other but rather, one is the inverse of the
	other and the same foreign key column is used for both associations.
	Thus our <code class="literal">Lecturer</code> object now has a property
	which is a collection of <code class="literal">Student</code> objects while the
	<code class="literal">Student</code> objects have a properties which
	refers to the <code class="literal">Student</code>'s supervising <code class="literal">Lecturer</code>.
	</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="hibernate_files/bidir_many_to_one.png" alt="A Many-to-One, bidirectional Association"><div class="caption"><p>
	      A Many-to-One, bidirectional Association
	    </p></div></div><p>
      </p><p>
	To achieve this, we start by using the
	<code class="literal">many-to-one</code> element as before in the mapping
	file for the <code class="literal">Student</code> class, and the
	<code class="literal">Set</code> element as before in the mapping file for
	the <code class="literal">Lecturer</code> class, ensuring that both
	associations use the same column in <code class="literal">Student</code>'s
	table to encode the association. Then we add a new attribute,
	<code class="literal">inverse="true"</code> to the <code class="literal">set</code>
	element in <code class="literal">Lecturer</code>'s mapping file. Without
	this, adding a new <code class="literal">Student</code> as an advisee to a
	<code class="literal">Lecturer</code> would trigger Hibernate to set the
	foreign key column of the <code class="literal">Student</code> table
	twice: once for each association that has been changed. The
	<code class="literal">inverse</code> attribute tells hibernate that
	<code class="literal">Student</code> owns the association and that
	Hibernate should not trigger updates of the foreign key column
	when it changes on the <code class="literal">Lecturer</code> side.
      </p><p>
	Thus the mapping file for <code class="literal">Lecturer</code> looks like this:
	</p><pre class="programlisting">&lt;?xml version="1.0"?&gt;
&lt;!DOCTYPE hibernate-mapping PUBLIC
          "-//Hibernate/Hibernate Mapping DTD//EN"
          "http://hibernate.sourceforge.net/hibernate-mapping-2.0.dtd"&gt;
&lt;hibernate-mapping&gt;
    &lt;class name="Lecturer" table="lecturers"&gt;
        &lt;id name="id" column="lecturer_id"&gt;
            &lt;generator class="sequence"/&gt;
        &lt;/id&gt;
        &lt;version name="version" column="version"/&gt;
        &lt;property name="name" column="name"/&gt;
        &lt;set name="advisees" inverse="true" cascade="save-update" lazy="true"&gt;
            &lt;key column="lecturer_id"/&gt;
            &lt;one-to-many class="Student"/&gt;
        &lt;/set&gt;
    &lt;/class&gt;
&lt;/hibernate-mapping&gt;</pre><p>
      </p><p>
	The mapping file for student is as follows:
	</p><pre class="programlisting">&lt;?xml version="1.0"?&gt;
&lt;!DOCTYPE hibernate-mapping PUBLIC
          "-//Hibernate/Hibernate Mapping DTD//EN"
          "http://hibernate.sourceforge.net/hibernate-mapping-2.0.dtd"&gt;
&lt;hibernate-mapping&gt;
    &lt;class name="Student" table="students"&gt;
        &lt;id name="id" column="student_id"&gt;
            &lt;generator class="sequence"/&gt;
        &lt;/id&gt;
        &lt;version name="version" column="version"/&gt; 
        &lt;property name="name" column="name"/&gt;
        &lt;property name="regNo" column="reg_no"/&gt;
        &lt;many-to-one name="advisor" column="lecturer_id" cascade="save-update"/&gt;
    &lt;/class&gt;
&lt;/hibernate-mapping&gt;</pre><p>
       </p><p>
	Now all the programmer has to do is to ensure that, when the
	<code class="literal">Lecturer</code>'s <code class="literal">advisee</code>
	property property is changed, the corresponding correct changes
	are made to the appropriate <code class="literal">Student</code>'s
	<code class="literal">advisor</code> property. So long as both are done
	together, the Java object graph will be correct and the correct
	update on disk will be made as well. Furthermore, since the
	association belongs to the <code class="literal">Student</code>, there
	will never be an insert of a <code class="literal">Student</code> record
	with a null <code class="literal">Lecturer</code> foreign key if the
	<code class="literal">Student</code> has an advisor, thus avoiding
	not-null constraint breaking. To ensure that these updates are
	made together, it is usual to add some convenience methods: in
	<code class="literal">Lecturer</code>, change the <code class="literal">getAdvisees()</code> and
	<code class="literal">setAdvisees()</code> methods to
	<code class="literal">private</code> and add a convenience method to
	update the object graph correctly when adding a new <code class="literal">Student</code>
	advisee to a <code class="literal">Lecturer</code>:
	</p><pre class="programlisting">    public void addAdvisee(Student st)
    {
        Lecturer oldAdvisor = st.getAdvisor() ;
        if (oldAdvisor != this)
        {
            if (oldAdvisor != null)
                oldAdvisor.getAdvisees().remove(st) ;
            st.setAdvisor(this);
            advisees.add(st) ;
        }
    }</pre><p>
        Note how we are careful to correctly handle removal of a
        <code class="literal">Student</code> from a previous advising
        <code class="literal">Lecturer</code> before adding it to this one.
	Whether you need to do something similar for your code will
	depend on your detailed design.
      </p><p>
	If we have a true composition relationship, i.e., a parent-child
	relationship where if the parent gets deleted then the child
	should also be deleted etc., then we should change the
	<code class="literal">cascade</code> attribute on the
	<code class="literal">set</code> element in the
	<code class="literal">Lecturer</code> mapping file to be <code class="literal">all-delete-orphan</code>.

      There is still plenty more to learn about Hibernate. There are
      one-to-one and many-to-many associations, value (as opposed to
      entity) collections, outer-join and batch fetching,
      <span class="emphasis"><em>Iterate</em></span> queries,
      <span class="emphasis"><em>Criteria</em></span> queries and the whole of the
      <span class="emphasis"><em>HQL</em></span> query language, not to mention explicit
      <span class="emphasis"><em>SQL</em></span> queries. There are alternative strategies
      for inheritance hierarchy mapping and polymorphism handling. There
      are user-defined data types and mappings, Interceptors, caching
      and all the Hibernate related tools. All of this and more are
      discussed on the Hibernate web site and in the book.
