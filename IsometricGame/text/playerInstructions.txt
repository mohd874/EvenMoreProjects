Click on your character to select him.  If you get a green square under the 
character, that means you have selected the right one.  If you get a square
other than green under the character, you have not selected a character under
your control.

Once you have selected a character, Right-click on the ground to walk to that 
square.  Click on objects in your inventory to pick them up.  Right-click on 
the map to throw an object to that square (if you are strong enough to throw it there)
