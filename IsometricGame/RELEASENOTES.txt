To run jIsoMan, unzip the zip file into a directory, go to the directory, and run 

java IsometricGame/Server/GameServer

for the server and then

java IsometricGame/Client/GameStandalone

You need to run the java command from the previous 
directory because of the package situation.  If anyone knows how to make
the packaging better or how to set up jars to work with file I/O, please tell me, thanks.
